# NonEuclidean Worlds

#### Abstract

Virtual Reality offers people a unique way to experience virtual worlds.
With the help of this technology, they can explore virtual environments as if they were almost there.
A persistent problem, however, is the implementation of locomotion in VR.
For users to experience virtual environments as naturally as possible, the locomotion must consequently also be as natural as possible.
Natural walking has proven to be the best approach in terms of the naturalness of locomotion.
However, this approach brings up new limitations.
The size of the virtual world is bound to the size of the physically available space.
This work focuses on an approach to overcome these limitations.
Our concept of portal-backed non-euclidean worlds allows fitting larger worlds into smaller physical spaces.
By investigating the perception of these non-euclidean worlds new conclusions can be drawn.
Therefore, we have compared the perception of non-euclidean worlds in VR with the perception of standard desktop environments in a study.
The results of our study show that the participants of our study did not perceive the virtual environment as non-euclidean.
We were able to shorten a distance by 50% without this being noticed by the participants.
The insights from our study show that non-euclidean worlds provide an interesting approach to reduce the limitations of the physical world when using natural walking as locomotion in VR.
